# Client Term Deposit Subscription Classification

## Overview

This project aims to classify which clients are most likely to subscribe to a term deposit. The primary goal is to enable the bank to target its marketing efforts more effectively, optimizing resource allocation and potentially increasing the success rate of its campaigns. 

## Goal

The goal of this project is to predict whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit, represented by a binary target variable initially labeled as 'y'. After data cleaning and preparation, this variable is renamed 'response'. Using various features from the dataset, each client is classified as either 'yes' (indicating they will subscribe to a term deposit) or 'no' (indicating they will not). This classification will help the bank identify potential subscribers more effectively.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project includes various features related to clients' personal information and their previous interactions with the bank. The target variable 'response' indicates whether the client subscribed to a term deposit ('yes') or not ('no').

## Steps and Methodology

1. **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, outliers, and any inconsistencies in the dataset.
2. **Data Preparation**: Feature selection, encoding categorical variables, and splitting the data into training and testing sets.
3. **Model Selection**: Various machine learning models will be tested and evaluated, including but not limited to Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Gradient Boosting.
4. **Model Training**: Training the selected models on the training dataset.
5. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluating the models using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
6. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimizing the model parameters to improve performance.
7. **Prediction**: Using the trained model to predict the target variable on new data.
8. **Results and Analysis**: Analyzing the model performance and understanding the importance of different features.
